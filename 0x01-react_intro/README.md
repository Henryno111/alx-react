## React App

This sub-README provides a further introduction to React and highlights the use of a React app.

### Introduction to React

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to create reusable UI components and efficiently update and render them when the underlying data changes. React follows a component-based architecture, making it easy to build complex UIs by composing smaller, reusable components.

### Setting up a React App

To create a React app, you can use the `create-react-app` command-line tool. Here's how you can set up a new React app:

1. Install Node.js if you haven't already. You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org

2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your React app.

3. Run the following command to create a new React app:

  ```bash
  npx create-react-app my-app
  ```

  This will create a new directory called `my-app` with the basic structure and configuration files for a React app.

4. Navigate into the `my-app` directory:

  ```bash
  cd my-app
  ```

5. Start the development server by running the following command:

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

  This will start the development server and open your React app in your default browser. Any changes you make to your code will automatically be reflected in the browser.

### Working with React Components

React components are the building blocks of a React app. They encapsulate the UI logic and can be composed together to create complex UIs. Here's an example of a simple React component:
